This is a tutorial on how to turn a raspberry pi into a webcam. You can use this to spy on your pet at home. I made this to watch my Spanish Water Dog, Dempster, while I was at work. 



Part 1 will walk you through etching an SD and installing Raspbian onto the Raspberry Pi. 

Part 2 will walk you through installing and configuring the Raspberry Pi to continually take a photo 

Part 3 will walk you through setting up wifi on your Raspberry Pi and setting a static IP 

Part 4 will walk you through setting up Port Forwarding and Dynamic DNS
